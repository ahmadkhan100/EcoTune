# EcoTune: Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning Platform

EcoTune is an open-source platform designed to help engineers fine-tune cheap and high-quality Language Models (LLMs) as alternatives to slow and expensive prompted models. Our goal is to make LLM fine-tuning more accessible, efficient, and cost-effective for a wide range of applications.

## Features

- Efficient data processing and tokenization
- Easy-to-use model loading and fine-tuning capabilities
- Advanced optimization techniques including pruning and quantization
- Extensible architecture for custom implementations

## Installation

To install EcoTune, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EcoTune.git
   cd EcoTune
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```
   python -m venv ecotune-env
   source ecotune-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ecotune-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install EcoTune:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started with EcoTune:

```python
from ecotune.data_processing.dataset import EcoTuneDataset
from ecotune.models.model_loader import load_model
from ecotune.models.model_trainer import ModelTrainer
from ecotune.optimization.pruning import prune_model
from ecotune.optimization.quantization import quantize_model

# Load your data (replace with your actual data loading logic)
train_data = [{"text": "Example text 1", "label": 0}, {"text": "Example text 2", "label": 1}]
val_data = [{"text": "Validation text", "label": 1}]

# Load a pre-trained model and tokenizer
model, tokenizer = load_model("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)

# Create datasets
train_dataset = EcoTuneDataset(train_data, tokenizer, max_length=128)
val_dataset = EcoTuneDataset(val_data, tokenizer, max_length=128)

# Initialize trainer and train the model
trainer = ModelTrainer(model, train_dataset, val_dataset)
trainer.train(epochs=3)

# Optimize the model
pruned_model = prune_model(model)
quantized_model = quantize_model(pruned_model)

# Save the optimized model
quantized_model.save_pretrained("optimized_model")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Data Loading

You can create custom data loaders by extending the `EcoTuneDataset` class:

```python
class CustomDataset(EcoTuneDataset):
    def __init__(self, data_path, tokenizer, max_length):
        data = self.load_data(data_path)
        super().__init__(data, tokenizer, max_length)

    def load_data(self, data_path):
        # Implement your custom data loading logic here
        pass
```

### Custom Fine-Tuning Strategies

To implement custom fine-tuning strategies, you can extend the `ModelTrainer` class:

```python
class CustomTrainer(ModelTrainer):
    def train(self, epochs, learning_rate=2e-5):
        # Implement your custom training logic here
        pass
```

### Custom Optimization Techniques

You can add custom optimization techniques by creating new functions in the `optimization` module:

```python
# In ecotune/optimization/custom_optim.py
def custom_optimization(model):
    # Implement your custom optimization logic here
    return optimized_model
```
